Design a REST API for para a api vai ser em hono + supabase/ssr, quero fazer essa api isolada para facil utilizacao em outros frameworks, a principio usarei em next/nuxt. sera uma api omminichannel, para gerenciar whatsapp, telegram, instagram, analytics (gtm, gtm server-side, tracker de uso proprio (e.g: injetar cookie + facebook pixel+ gtm events ao clicar em um botao e armazenar os dados no nosso banco de dados para trackear e segmentar os usuarios e gerar predicts...) api multimodal gemini, anthrhropic, api wp-headless, leads manager, projectmanager, chat ao vivo, e.g, telegram, instagram, whatsaapp, metricas..)

Thoughts (experimental)

**Considering the Framework**

I'm currently focusing on the core technologies: Hono and Supabase. The need for server-side rendering strongly suggests the implementation of Supabase Auth, Row-Level Security, and Database integration. My aim is to design an isolated API that's simple to integrate into other frameworks.

**Analyzing the Architecture**

I've been mapping out the core entities needed for the API. Key resources include Channels (WhatsApp, Telegram, Instagram), Users, Messages, and Analytics events. I'm focusing on RESTful principles and JWT authentication. I'm also considering the integration of server-side Google Tag Manager for more advanced analytics tracking.

**Outlining API Functions**

Currently, I'm defining the key API functions. The core will handle channel management (WhatsApp, Telegram, Instagram), encompassing message handling, contact management, and analytics tracking. I'm focusing on defining REST endpoints for creating, reading, updating, and deleting each entity. Authentication will be JWT-based. I'm also planning to integrate Gemini and Anthropic AI models, and fetch content from WP-Headless.

**Detailing Functionality**

I'm now diving into the specifics of API functionality. I'm concentrating on designing CRUD operations for channels and messages, and defining endpoints for incoming and outgoing messages within each channel. I'm also planning the design of the webhook endpoints. Considering the nuances of different messaging platforms is key.

**Mapping API Endpoints**

I'm now concretizing the endpoint design. I'm focusing on CRUD operations for each key entity, ensuring alignment with RESTful principles. I'm also considering the specific actions needed for omni-channel message handling, analytics event logging, and interactions with AI models and headless WordPress content. I'm also planning the design of the webhook endpoints.

**Finalizing Endpoint Design**

I've meticulously mapped out the endpoints, CRUD operations, and webhook integrations needed for each core entity, now integrating them with authentication. I'm now determining the optimal strategy for the proprietary analytics events and the content retrieval from WP-Headless. I'm also considering tenant separation, while still planning the single-tenant setup.

**Refining Authentication Strategies**

I'm now focusing on a robust authentication system. I plan to use Supabase for user authentication, issuing JWTs for API access. For API keys, I'll integrate a system for server-to-server communication if needed. I'm also ensuring tight data security with Row Level Security in Supabase.

**Designing Supabase Interactions**

I'm currently focusing on the Supabase integration, specifically table design and data modeling, for the API. I'm exploring the best approach for the database schema, including the use of JSONB for flexible fields, ensuring robust data security with Row Level Security, and implementing API keys for server-to-server communication if needed.

**Structuring the Data**

I've been exploring the key entities in detail, focusing on Channels, Messages, Contacts, and Analytics Events. The goal is to define data models to ensure efficient storage and retrieval. I'm also planning the API key and authentication infrastructure for securing server-to-server and client-to-server communication, respectively. I'm also considering the use of JSONB for flexible data fields in Supabase.

**Structuring Data and Access**

I'm now focusing on securing the API, planning the implementation of authentication with JWTs issued by Supabase. I'll design RLS policies to safeguard sensitive data within Supabase. Concurrently, I'm working on the data model for the API. I'm also planning the API key and authentication infrastructure for securing server-to-server and client-to-server communication, respectively.

**Structuring Data Access**

I'm solidifying the data model, focusing on defining and securing the data access patterns. I'm focusing on defining tables and data relationships. Row-Level Security in Supabase will be a key strategy for safeguarding the data. Now, I'm working to secure the API using Supabase and JWT authentication. I'm also planning the API key and authentication infrastructure for securing server-to-server and client-to-server communication, respectively.

**Focusing on API Architecture**

I'm now integrating the Supabase database schema design. I've considered channels, messages, and contact structures to establish the core tables for the API. I'm focusing on the implementation of Row-Level Security and JWT-based authentication for data security. I'm also preparing the design for API keys for server-to-server communication if needed.

Okay, this is an ambitious and exciting project! An omnichannel API built with Hono and Supabase is a great choice for flexibility and performance. Here's a design proposal, keeping in mind your requirements for isolation and use in frameworks like Next.js/Nuxt.js.

**Core Principles:**

- **Stateless:** The API will be stateless, relying on JWTs (from Supabase Auth) for authentication.
- **RESTful:** Follow REST principles for resource naming and HTTP methods.
- **JSON:** Use JSON for request and response bodies.
- **Supabase Integration:**
	- **Auth:** Supabase Auth for user management and JWT generation.
	- **Database:** Supabase Postgres for storing all data (channels, messages, leads, analytics, etc.).
	- **RLS (Row Level Security):** Crucial for multi-tenancy (if applicable) and ensuring users only access their own data.
	- **Storage:** For media attachments in messages.
	- **Edge Functions (Optional):** Some Hono routes could potentially be deployed as Supabase Edge Functions if desired for proximity or specific scaling needs, though a dedicated Hono server is also fine.
- **Hono:**
	- Lightweight and fast router.
	- Middleware for auth, validation (e.g., Zod), logging.
- **Modularity:** Design endpoints in a modular way, grouping by functionality.

---

**I. Authentication & Authorization**

- **Method:** JWT Bearer Tokens issued by Supabase Auth.
- **Hono Middleware:**
	- Verify JWT.
	- Extract user\_id (and potentially org\_id or tenant\_id if you have multi-tenancy) from the token.
	- Make user information available in the Hono context (c.get('user')).
- **Endpoints:**
	- Supabase handles /auth/v1/signup, /auth/v1/token?grant\_type=password, /auth/v1/user, /auth/v1/logout etc., directly. Your Next/Nuxt frontend will interact with these.
	- Your API will simply consume the JWTs generated by Supabase.

```
// Example Hono Auth Middleware (simplified)
import { createMiddleware } from 'hono/factory'
import { verify } from 'hono/jwt' // Or use Supabase's own libraries

const authMiddleware = createMiddleware(async (c, next) => {
  const authHeader = c.req.header('Authorization');
  if (!authHeader || !authHeader.startsWith('Bearer ')) {
    return c.json({ error: 'Unauthorized', message: 'Bearer token missing' }, 401);
  }
  const token = authHeader.substring(7);
  try {
    // Replace with your Supabase JWT secret
    const decodedPayload = await verify(token, process.env.SUPABASE_JWT_SECRET!);
    // You might want to fetch user details from Supabase DB based on decodedPayload.sub (user_id)
    // to ensure the user still exists and has appropriate permissions.
    // For simplicity, we'll just pass the decoded payload.
    c.set('user', decodedPayload); // Contains { sub: 'user_id', role: 'authenticated', ... }
    await next();
  } catch (err) {
    return c.json({ error: 'Unauthorized', message: 'Invalid token' }, 401);
  }
});

// Apply middleware to protected routes
// app.use('/api/v1/*', authMiddleware);
```

- POST /api/v1/live-chat/sessions/{session\_id}/messages: Agent sends a message in a live chat.
	- (This might internally use the same mechanism as POST /api/v1/channels/{channel\_id}/messages)
- PUT /api/v1/live-chat/sessions/{session\_id}/status: Update session status (e.g., 'closed', 'resolved').
- (Supabase Realtime can be very useful here to push updates to agent dashboards).

**J. Metrics & Dashboards**

- These endpoints will typically aggregate data from other tables.
- GET /api/v1/metrics/overview: General stats (total messages, new leads, active chats).
- GET /api/v1/metrics/channel-performance: Performance per channel.
- GET /api/v1/metrics/agent-performance: Agent-specific metrics.
- (These can be complex and might involve SQL views or Supabase Functions for aggregation).

---

**III. Webhooks (Inbound from External Services)**

These are public-facing endpoints that external services (WhatsApp, Telegram, GTM Server-Side) will call. They should NOT require JWT auth but should have some form of signature verification or secret token check.

- /webhooks/whatsapp: Receives inbound messages and status updates from WhatsApp Cloud API / Twilio etc.
	- Verifies WhatsApp signature.
	- Processes message, creates/updates contact, stores message.
	- May trigger notifications or AI responses.
- /webhooks/telegram: Receives inbound messages from Telegram Bot API.
	- Verifies request (e.g., using a secret path or token).
	- Processes message.
- /webhooks/instagram: Receives inbound messages/mentions from Instagram Graph API.
	- Verifies Instagram signature.
	- Processes message.
- /webhooks/gtm-server: Endpoint for your GTM Server-Side container to send data to your backend.
	- Body: Data payload from GTM SS.
	- Processes and stores data, potentially linking it to contacts or leads.

**Example Hono Webhook Route (Conceptual):**

```
// In your Hono app
// import { Hono } from 'hono';
// const app = new Hono();

app.post('/webhooks/whatsapp', async (c) => {
  // 1. Verify WhatsApp Signature (critical!)
  //    const signature = c.req.header('X-Hub-Signature-256');
  //    const body = await c.req.raw.clone().text(); // Need raw body for signature
  //    if (!verifyWhatsappSignature(body, signature, process.env.WHATSAPP_APP_SECRET)) {
  //      return c.text('Invalid signature', 403);
  //    }

  const payload = await c.req.json();
  console.log('Received WhatsApp Webhook:', payload);

  // 2. Process the payload
  //    - Identify contact
  //    - Store message in Supabase
  //    - Trigger workflows (e.g., AI auto-reply, notify agent)
  //    const { messages, contacts } = payload.entry[0].changes[0].value;
  //    if (messages && messages[0]) {
  //        const incomingMessage = messages[0];
  //        const from = incomingMessage.from; // phone number
  //        const text = incomingMessage.text?.body;
  //        // ... logic to find/create contact, save message ...
  //    }

  return c.text('OK', 200); // WhatsApp expects a 200 OK
});
```

---

**IV. Supabase Database Schema (High-Level Ideas)**

- organizations (if multi-tenant: id, name)
- users (from Supabase Auth, extended with organization\_id, role\_in\_org)
- api\_credentials (id, service\_name, encrypted\_credentials, user\_id, organization\_id)
- channels (id, organization\_id, type, name, config\_json, status, created\_at, updated\_at)
- contacts (id, organization\_id, name, email, created\_at, updated\_at, custom\_fields\_jsonb)
- contact\_identifiers (id, contact\_id, channel\_type, identifier\_value, is\_primary) - e.g. (contact\_123, 'whatsapp', '+12345', true)
- messages (id, organization\_id, channel\_id, contact\_id, direction, content\_type, text\_content, media\_url, template\_name, metadata\_jsonb, status, timestamp, external\_message\_id)
- leads (id, organization\_id, contact\_id, name, email, phone, source, status, value, assigned\_to\_user\_id, notes, created\_at, updated\_at)
- tracked\_events (id, organization\_id, contact\_id, user\_cookie\_id, event\_name, page\_url, properties\_jsonb, timestamp)
- ai\_interactions\_log (id, organization\_id, user\_id, provider, model, prompt\_tokens, completion\_tokens, request\_payload\_jsonb, response\_payload\_jsonb, timestamp)
- wp\_content\_cache (id, organization\_id, source\_url\_or\_slug, content\_type, data\_jsonb, last\_fetched\_at)
- projects (id, organization\_id, name, description, status, due\_date, created\_at, updated\_at)
- tasks (id, organization\_id, project\_id, title, description, status, assigned\_to\_user\_id, due\_date, created\_at, updated\_at)
- live\_chat\_sessions (id, organization\_id, contact\_id, channel\_id, agent\_user\_id, status, start\_time, end\_time, last\_message\_at)

**RLS Policies:**  
Extensive use of RLS is critical. For example:

- A user can only see channels belonging to their organization\_id.
- An agent can only see leads/tasks assigned to them, or unassigned ones if they have permission.
- SELECT... FROM messages WHERE organization\_id = current\_setting('request.jwt.claims', true)::jsonb ->> 'app\_metadata'::text ->> 'organization\_id'::text; (This is a common pattern for RLS with custom JWT claims).

---

**V. Project Structure (Hono Example)**

```

  /api
    /v1
      auth.ts         // Middleware
      channels.ts     // Channel routes

```

---

**VI. Considerations & Next Steps:**

- **Error Handling:** Implement consistent error responses (e.g., { "error": "code", "message": "description" }).
- **Validation:** Use Zod for robust request body and parameter validation in Hono.
- **Logging:** Implement comprehensive logging (requests, errors, important events).
- **Rate Limiting:** Essential for public-facing webhooks and overall API stability.
- **Scalability:** Supabase scales well. Your Hono application can be deployed on various platforms (Fly.io, Vercel Serverless, Cloud Run, Supabase Edge Functions).
- **Security:**
	- HTTPS always.
	- Input sanitization.
	- Securely store external API keys (Supabase Vault if available, or encrypted in DB with careful key management).
	- Regularly review RLS policies.
- **Documentation:** Use OpenAPI (Swagger) to document your API. Hono has adaptors for this.
- **Client-Side Tracker JS:** You'll need to develop the JavaScript snippet that users will embed on their sites for the proprietary tracker. This script will:
	- Set/read a unique user cookie.
	- Attach event listeners (e.g., to buttons with specific attributes).
	- On event, gather data (page URL, element clicked, etc.).
	- Optionally trigger FB Pixel, GTM dataLayer.push.
	- Send data to your POST /api/v1/track/event endpoint.
- **GTM Server-Side Integration:**
	- Your GTM SS container can use its built-in HTTP request tag or a custom template to send data to /webhooks/gtm-server.
	- Alternatively, your API could send data to GTM SS via its event data collection endpoint if you want to trigger tags in GTM SS from your backend events.

This design provides a solid foundation. You'll iterate and refine as you build. Start with a core module (e.g., Channels & Messaging) and expand from there. Good luck!

Thoughts (experimental)

**Generating Code Snippets**

I've decided to prioritize the request for REST API examples by focusing on a basic Hono setup and Supabase client initialization. My next step involves crafting a concise example showing basic interaction. I'll showcase a simple route setup using Hono with Supabase authentication. This approach lets the user understand the core components without overwhelming them.

**Expanding Code Examples**

I'm now focusing on a more comprehensive structure. This includes basic Hono setup, Supabase client initialization, and an illustrative JWT authentication middleware. I'll include concise examples of CRUD operations for a 'Channels' resource. Additionally, I'll showcase a simple webhook handler and conceptual client-side tracking, along with Zod validation examples. I'll make sure to note that this is a starting point, not a complete solution.

**Developing Structure and Snippets**

I'm now integrating the Supabase client and building out the JWT authentication middleware within the Hono framework. I'm focusing on crafting a basic CRUD example using 'Channels' as a representative resource. I've also begun sketching the webhook handler and a conceptual client-side tracking snippet, complemented by Zod validation examples. These will be clearly labeled and placed in the project structure. This will be a starting point, to keep in mind, and not a fully complete solution.

**Defining Project Structure**

I'm now focusing on defining the project structure and breaking down the code examples into manageable parts. I've decided on an api/v1 directory for versioned API endpoints, a core directory for shared utilities like Supabase client initialization and Zod schemas, and a webhooks directory. I'll include clear instructions and an emphasis on these examples being starting points.

**Defining Example Structure**

I'm now focusing on defining the project structure. I've decided on an api/v1 directory for API endpoints, a core directory for Supabase client initialization and Zod schemas, and a webhooks directory. I'm prioritizing clear explanations and emphasizing these examples are starting points. My goal is to craft a manageable and understandable demonstration. I'll provide a simplified Supabase schema and include key environment variables.

**Refining Code Generation**

I'm now prioritizing the code generation, starting with the src/index.ts file. I'm focusing on the Hono setup, Supabase client initialization, and basic routing. I'll define the project structure, including the api/v1, core, and webhooks directories. I'll include clear environment variable explanations and a simplified Supabase schema example. The goal is to provide a concise and understandable starting point, with emphasis on the limitations.

Thoughts (experimental)

**Examining API Abstraction**

I'm currently focused on the user's central inquiry: why not employ a client-side API abstraction, similar to n8n's, rather than the approach of Hono/Supabase? I'm digging into the potential benefits and drawbacks, considering factors like flexibility, maintainability, and initial development time. The current thinking is that understanding the fundamental differences in architectural approaches will be key to a clear and concise explanation.

**Assessing Code Structure**

I've been analyzing the n8n code, particularly request(), and noticing its use of axios as a base. I'm focusing on how it handles requests, error mapping, and data serialization. I'm also examining the wrappers around request, aiming to grasp how n8n tailors the abstraction for its specific API needs. The use of flatted for complex data de-serialization is of interest.

**Clarifying Request Structure**

I'm now zeroing in on how request() handles HTTP methods, baseURL, and headers. The customization of paramsSerializer is particularly interesting. I'm noting how request() is built for flexibility within n8n's API context, looking at how it integrates custom error mapping. Then, I'll be comparing it to alternative approaches used by Hono/Supabase.

**Comparing Abstraction Approaches**

I'm now focusing on the client-side benefits of n8n's approach versus the server-side focus of Hono/Supabase. The key is to understand how each strategy impacts initial setup, flexibility, and maintenance. I'm considering the potential overhead of managing a client-side API abstraction in the user's context, where a robust server-side API may offer advantages. I'm exploring the trade-offs.

**Understanding streamRequest**

I'm now focusing on streamRequest() in the n8n code and how it handles streaming data with fetch. I'm examining its reliance on a custom separator and how it's designed to process and parse streamed responses effectively. I'm also considering the implications of server-sent events for our Hono API.

**Comparing Client and Server Roles**

I'm now focusing on the fundamental difference: n8n's code acts as a client-side API helper, whereas Hono/Supabase define the server-side API. The user will still need client-side code similar to n8n's request() to consume the Hono API. My goal is to clearly illustrate the distinct responsibilities of client-side and server-side components. This comparison seeks to clarify their respective roles.

**Delineating Component Roles**

I'm now clarifying the key distinction: the n8n code serves as a client-side API helper, while Hono/Supabase define the server-side API. The user will still need client-side code similar to n8n's request() to interact with the Hono API. My goal is to delineate the distinct responsibilities of client-side and server-side components.

**Distinguishing Roles and Tasks**

I'm now recognizing the n8n code functions as a client-side utility, which differs from Hono/Supabase's API approach. To be clear, the user will need a client-side request library for their Next/Nuxt app. The Hono API will use server-side logic for its outbound integrations. I will clarify this in detail.

**Comparing and Contrasting Roles**

I'm now focusing on the core difference: n8n's code serves as a client-side API helper, while Hono/Supabase define a server-side API. The user will still need client-side code similar to n8n's request() to consume the Hono API. My goal is to clearly distinguish their roles.

Thoughts (experimental)

**Refining API Requirements**

I've been meticulously examining the user's need for a multi-integration, omnichannel API. My focus is now on meticulously dissecting the various features requested within the messaging framework. The initial challenge lies in mapping these user-defined features into a structured database schema and subsequent API endpoints. I am starting by outlining core entities and establishing their critical relationships.

**Establishing the Data Model**

I'm now focusing on the data model that will underpin the API. Key entities are becoming clear: Users, Organizations, Channels, and Contacts. My strategy is to map the user's requested features directly into database tables, ensuring data integrity. I'm prioritizing the relationship between users and organizations, as this will define the scope of all other data. Securing channels and their credentials is paramount.

**Developing the Data Structure**

My focus is now on mapping the user's features into concrete data structures. I've expanded on the established entities, including the crucial multi-tenant architecture with organizations. I am outlining the 'Channels' table, which I'll extend to include channel-specific attributes for each integration type. The 'Contacts' table is being expanded to accommodate multi-channel identifiers. Finally, I'm refining the messaging and interaction logging, with the addition of analytics and AI tables.

**Constructing Core Entities**

My current focus is on solidifying the data model, now considering the comprehensive features list. I've begun to define the key entities, starting with users and organizations. I'm meticulously considering the relationships and potential fields within each entity, including timestamps and foreign keys. Further, I'm structuring a contacts table, ensuring it's tied to an organization\_id.

**Outlining API Infrastructure**

My focus has shifted to the API structure, and I'm detailing the key aspects for optimal organization. I've begun planning endpoints for core entities like channels, contacts, and messages, using RESTful principles. I am developing authentication and validation middlewares, incorporating best practices. I'm also planning modular routers to streamline the API design and ensure maintainability.

**Defining the Data Structure**

My focus is on fleshing out the database structure to enable all the requested features. I'm now establishing a table for contact identifiers to facilitate cross-channel tracking. Moreover, I'm working on the data model for the AI interactions and content caching. I'm prioritizing the user authentication via Supabase and integrating it with the user data.

**Defining API Endpoints**

I'm currently working on defining API endpoints using RESTful principles. Key focus areas include authentication and validation middleware. Using modular routers within Hono, I'm aiming for a structure that facilitates maintainability. My core endpoints include /channels, /contacts, and /messages.

**Establishing Initial Database Design**

I've completed my initial pass on the database design, primarily focusing on users, organizations, channels, and contacts tables. I am currently concentrating on incorporating message logs, including their associations with channels, contacts, and organizations. I'm also planning the design for webhooks integration.

**Defining Webhook Integration**

I am now focusing on the integration of webhooks, specifically how they will receive and process data from different channels. The structure includes creating modular and secure webhooks routes. For inbound messages, I've outlined the process of receiving data, processing, and storing into the respective tables. Furthermore, I've started the design of the channel\_credentials for storing channel specific credentials.

Thoughts (experimental)

**Exploring Design Alternatives**

I've been meticulously examining the n8n database schema, particularly the "integration" table's structure, in relation to our omnichannel API design. My focus has sharpened on the integration table and how its structure could inform our design choices. I'm aiming to uncover any significant benefits or drawbacks associated with mirroring their approach.

**Evaluating Structural Parallels**

My comparison has advanced. I'm deep diving into the credentials\_entity and how it handles different authentication types compared to our proposed approach. I am scrutinizing the implications of adopting n8n's design for our own security considerations and scalability objectives. The installed\_nodes table is proving particularly relevant as I analyze its role in managing different connection types.

**Contrasting Core Concepts**

My perspective has shifted. The focus on mirroring n8n's design is proving less relevant. The conceptual framework behind their integrations fundamentally differs from our channels approach. Their "integration" translates to a "node" that fits into a workflow, while our design centers on managing the "state" of external channels and services.

**Evaluating Endpoint Structure**

I've been analyzing the potential structure of a consolidated /integrations endpoint and how it would interact with our current API design. I'm exploring different options and approaches for organizing /integrations endpoint logic. I'm also considering the potential downsides of such a design and its impact on maintainability.

**Examining Schema Comparisons**

My focus has shifted again. I'm moving from a direct comparison to a deeper conceptual analysis. n8n's design focuses on "nodes" and a generalized "webhook\_entity" for trigger definitions. Our design, however, handles "integrations" and webhooks in relation to channels. The key difference highlights our API already has channels and corresponding logic. I'm confident our approach is more suitable for managing specific, diverse communication channels.

**Revising Integration Concepts**

I've refined my perspective on the integration aspect. n8n's integrations act as nodes within workflows; ours are channels. Instead of focusing on replicating a generic integration endpoint, I'm now exploring the optimal use of /channels and api\_credentials. I am confident that these are sufficient for our current design. I am also evaluating whether or not an additional outbound webhook table would be beneficial.

**Evaluating Webhook Structures**

I'm now fully immersed in comparing how n8n and our API approaches outbound webhooks. We have inbound webhooks handled efficiently, so I am weighing the benefits of a webhooks table for outbound notifications. I believe this would be a best practice. It will enhance our system's ability to trigger external systems and add more flexibility.

**Evaluating Architectural Differences**

Our comparison has brought greater clarity. While the n8n schema is well-suited for its purpose, it's divergent from our design. Their "integrations" represent nodes in workflows, while ours manage channels and service connections. The primary difference is the structure of the entities that we are modeling.

**Revisiting Channel Structure**

I've been examining the optimal organization of channels within our API architecture, specifically evaluating whether the current use of /channels remains the ideal structure. We already manage different channels, so I am considering whether a channel\_type\_enum for each channel is sufficient or if an abstract channel interface would be beneficial.

Thoughts (experimental)

**Outlining API Architecture**

I've started by deeply understanding the core request: crafting thorough documentation and foundational code for a Hono-based omnichannel API. The initial focus is on outlining the API architecture, pinpointing key features, and defining the core functionalities it should encompass. My goal is to create a solid framework.

**Mapping Out Core Features**

I'm now zeroing in on detailing the API's core features. This involves mapping out lead funnels, LLM integration, and semantic search. The tech stack, including Hono, Supabase, and workflow automation, is being fleshed out. The initial focus is on the connections, workflows, and workflow\_executions tables. I am prioritising core code generation, since generating all of it is impossible!

**Prioritizing Code Generation**

I'm now zeroing in on code generation priorities. I will create Hono boilerplate, Supabase setup, and JWT authentication middleware. I'll craft a Channels module as a CRUD example and develop foundational workflows.routes.ts, workflows.services.ts, and a high-level workflow\_engine/executor.ts. I will conceptualize services for AI and embeddings, and demonstrate Supabase Vault and webhook integration.

**Finalizing Documentation Structure**

I've decided to finalize the documentation structure, ensuring a solid foundation for the project. I've broken it into standard project sections: an overview, core features, and tech stack. Crucially, I'm focusing on key sections like the database schema, API endpoint design, and the conceptual workflow engine. The goal is to provide a clear and accessible roadmap.

**Finalizing the Code Strategy**

I've clarified the code generation strategy. I'll focus on foundational elements: Hono/Supabase boilerplate, JWT authentication, and a CRUD Channels module. For workflows, I'll provide routes.ts, services.ts, and a high-level executor skeleton. I'll also demonstrate Supabase Vault and robust webhook handling. I've re-reviewed the database schema to make sure it is updated.

**Defining the Code Structure**

I've made the decision to define the code structure, mapping out the architecture. I'm prioritizing the core Hono application setup, Supabase client initialization, and essential API modules. The goal is to provide a solid foundation for more complex features to be added later. I've also re-reviewed the database schema to make sure it is updated.

Thoughts (experimental)

**Refining API Structure**

I'm currently working on completing core API modules like 'contacts' and 'messages' to establish a clear structural foundation. My focus now is also on sketching a comprehensive README.md to guide users through the project's architecture.

**Developing Key Modules**

I've just finalized the initial drafts of the contacts and messages modules, including validators, routes, and services, forming a solid basis. My current emphasis is on sketching a concrete node\_handler for the workflow\_engine. I'm also planning a basic WhatsApp webhook handler and drafting Zod validators. Focusing on Supabase integration, modularity with Hono, workflows, AI, and pgvector remains my guiding principles.

**Implementing Key Components**

I'm now focusing on completing core API modules and services, starting with contacts and messages. This involves crafting validators, routes, and services for a functional structure. I'm also drafting a WhatsApp webhook handler and a concrete node\_handler for the workflow\_engine. I'll also create several placeholder files for types, modules, and handlers, to demonstrate the project's architecture. The main principles remain integration, modularity, workflows, AI, and pgvector.
